<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>When I hear "Accessibility"</h2>
<p>Accessibility is something that I find very important in today's society.
  When it comes down to it, a lack of accessibility is rooted almost entirely
  in laziness and corporate greed. Businesses don't want to have to spend more
  money than they thing they "have" to. But in today's world, that is just not
  acceptable. We need to do better for our fellow humans to make the world
  better and more accessible.
</p>
<h2>Automated Tools are NOT enough</h2>
<p>Automated tools can be useful. It is a great starting off point to find
  very obvious flaws. But they should not be seen as a be all end all. We can
  use these tools in conjunction with our knowledge of accessibility to create
  more accessible websites.
</p>
<h3>Acessibilty Standards I Use</h3>
<p>WCAG Guidelines are one thing that is cruicial in understanding accessible 
  web content. WCAG 2.1 is the current standard, and WCAG 2.2 is currently being 
finalized. In order to help achieve these standards, W3C has guides which give
helpful pointers and instructions.
</p>
<h3>Why Inclusion During Design Matters</h3>
<p>I have seen first hand what it's like to find work arounds and solve problems that arise from designing for the 
  averages. Being 6'9", while I acknowledge that I do not have to deal with the problems that many disabled people do, I can
  sympathize as someone that lives in a world that was not built for their personal challenges. It is because of this
  that I would love to live in a world that embraces people for their differences and designs inclusively so that
  everyone can have the same amount of joy and excitement over their every day life.

<h2>My Accessibilty Statement</h2>
<p>This is an accessibility statement from Travis Howey</p>
<h4>Measures to support accessibilty</h4>
<p>
  We take the following measures to ensure accessibility:
</p>
<ul class="dashed">
  <li> Include accessibility as part of our mission statement.</li>
  <li> Include accessibility throughout our internal policies.</li>
  <li> Provide continual accessibility training for our staff.</li>
  <li> Assign clear accessibility goals and responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conformance status</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a>
  defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility 
  for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level 
  A, Level AA, and Level AAA. WEBSITE_NAME is partially conformant with WCAG 
  2.1 level AA. Partially conformant means that some parts of the content do
  not fully conform to the accessibility standard.</p>
