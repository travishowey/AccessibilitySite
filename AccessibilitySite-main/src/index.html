    <h2>Disabilities in the United States</h2>
    <p>
      The 2021 American Community Survey by the Census Bureau reported 13% of all Americans 
      have a non-institutionalized disability. Of the roughly 38,903,887 adults with a disability in the 
      United States, 19.7% of them live below the poverty line. This is almost double the number of 
      adults in the United States who are below the poverty line. This is partially due to lower rates of 
      employment for disabled people. In the United States, 25.9% of disabled people over the age of 
      16 are employed in the civilian sector, while 59.6% of all US citizens over 16 are employed in 
      the same sector. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Comparing the breakdown of disability between my current state of residence, Utah, and the 
      United States, Utah has a disabled population of 342,378 or 10.3% of the total population, 
      compared to the United States which has 42,485,034 disabled people or 13.0% of the total 
      population. Table 1: Disability Type by Gender for Utah and the United States shows the 
      disparities between genders and types of disabilities.

        <p>
          There are a few reasons why these disparities exist; however, that is not a topic for this page. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to representation by race, there are some interesting differences between Utah 
          and the United States. Table 2: Disability Percent by Race, you can see that Utah has a higher 
          occurrence of disabilities in the Black or African American, American Indian and Alaska Natives, 
          Native Hawai’ian and Other Pacific Islanders, and the Hispanic or Latino communities than the 
          United States as a whole. However, for the White community in Utah, they have a lower 
          occurrence of disability than the national rate. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When we take into consideration the rates of disabilities in the United States (roughly 40 
          million people) and Utah (roughly 350,000 people), we can understand the importance of 
          building accessible experiences for all people.
