<h1>Site Design Explanations</h1>

<h2>Visual Design</h2>
<p>One of the key themes that I really wanted to stick to with this site was simple design. This included using simple
    colors and fonts in order to try to keep the site as readable as possible. By keeping the colors to a minimum, I
    wanted to make sure the visual distractions were kept to a minimum. By keeping the fonts simple and minimal, I
    attempted to keep visual distractions to a minimum as well.
</p>
<p>
    The colors chosen for the site were also chosen with color blind users in mind. The orange and green colors that 
    the site does use are at risk of causing some issues with blue-yellow color blind users, the way these colors are
    implemented on the site should cause little to no problem. Once the colors were implemented on the site, the site 
    was tested using Window's built in color filters and it passed all checks.
</p>

<h2>Structural Design</h2>
<p>
    The structural design of the website was created with the explicit intent of keeping things as accessible as possible.
    This was achieved in a meriad of ways. One of these ways was by keeping the design very straightforward. There 
    is not a lot of multi-column layouts. This way screen readers would be able to really just read straight down the 
    page without needing to jump around much.
</p>
<p>
    Another way I really tried to emphasise structural design in my website was by using the things I was taught in
    class to make the site as accessible as possible. One of the tactics that I employed was creating tables with
    accessibility in mind first. Using scopes to define rows and columns of the table helps, as well as using captions
    to give a quick understanding of the content of the table. Along this same line of thinking, when showing images,
    I used very descriptive alt text in order to describe the image in great detail so that someone who might be 
    visually impaired is still able to understand the content of the image.
